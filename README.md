# Blood-Donation-Prediction
Problem Statement

amongst donors based on a limited number of attributes

Dataset Link:

Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a
serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there&#39;s
enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health
professionals. According to WebMD,&quot;about 5 million Americans need a blood
transfusion every year&quot;. Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan.
The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood
as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the
next time the vehicle comes to campus in March 2007
